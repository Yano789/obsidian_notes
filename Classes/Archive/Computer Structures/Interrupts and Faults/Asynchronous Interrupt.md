aliases:
  - Hardware Interrupt

Mainly comes from the [[IRQ Signal]] and [[IRQ Unit]] in the Beta CPU

Generated by other hardware devices and arbitrary/random times **thus we need to synchronize (CLK)** 

CPU will continuously check if IRQ:
- If IRQ == 1: the CPU will store the OPCODE Address and Handle the Interrupt
- If IRQ != 1: The CPU will run as normal

This forces the CPU to transfer control to the interrupt handler. Requiring the [[User Program]] to enter [[Classes/Computer System Engineering/The Computer System/Operating System (OS)/Kernel/Kernel#Kernel Mode (PC31 MSB = 1)|Kernel Mode]] 

Thus the **Interrupt Handler** will do the following:
1. Save the register states (interrupted program instruction) into the process table
2. Transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routing, depending on the [[Device Controllers|device controller]] that made the request

1. **[[Device Controllers#I/O|I/O]] Devices**: Runs *asynchronously*, capable of being "smart" and *run its own instructions*
2. **[[Device Controllers]]**: Attached to the *motherboard*, runs *asynchronously*, may run simple instructions. *Has its own buffers, registers, and simple instructions interpreter*. Data Transfer to and fro the I/O through standard protocols such as USB, A/C, HDMI, DP, etc.
3. **Disk Controller:** same as [[Device Controllers]] but specific to control disks
