Mainly comes from the [[IRQ Signal]] and [[IRQ Unit]] in the Beta CPU

![[Asynchronous Interrupt-1.webp]]

Generated by other hardware devices and arbitrary/random times **thus we need to synchronize (CLK)** 

CPU will continuously check if IRQ:
- If IRQ == 1: the CPU will store the OPCODE Address and Handle the Interrupt
- If IRQ != 1: The CPU will run as normal

This forces the CPU to transfer control to the interrupt handler. Requiring the [[User Program]] to enter [[Classes/Computer System Engineering/The Computer System/Operating System (OS)/Kernel#Kernel Mode (PC31 MSB = 1)|Kernel Mode]] 

Thus the **Interrupt Handler** will do the following:
1. Save the register states (interrupted program instruction) into the process table
2. Transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routing, depending on the [[Device Controllers|device controller]] that made the request
