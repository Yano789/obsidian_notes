there exists the **tendency** of a CPU to access the same set of memory locations **repetitively** over a short period of time.

**Two Main Types**
1. [[Temporal Locality]] - when a program accesses the same memory location multiple times within a short time span

2. [[Spatial Locality]] - when a program accesses memory locations that are physically close to each other, such as elements in an array (sequentially)
