Whether a graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸) is directed or undirected, an edge 𝑒 (an element in 𝐸) consists of two vertices, say vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣. 

- **𝑒=(𝑢,𝑣) if 𝐺 is directed**
- **𝑒 = {𝑢,𝑣} if 𝐺 is undirected.**

we say u and/or v are **INCIDENT** to e

If two vertices are incident to the same edge, they are **ADJACENT**
