an assignment of real values called weights to the edges of $𝐺$.

The weight of an edge $𝑒$ is the real value $𝑤(𝑒)$.
- If $𝑒$ is the pair ${𝑢, 𝑣}$ or $(𝑢,𝑣)$, then we can write $𝑤(𝑒)$ as $𝑤(𝑢,𝑣)$.

The weight of a [[Path]] $(𝑒_1,𝑒_2,…,𝑒_𝑘)$ is the sum of the weights of the edges in the [[Path]], i.e. $𝑤(𝑒_1) +⋯+𝑤(𝑒_𝑘)$ 
- If $𝑝$ represents the [[Path]] $(𝑒1,𝑒2,…,𝑒𝑘)$, then we can write the weight of this [[Path]] as $𝑤(𝑝)$.
