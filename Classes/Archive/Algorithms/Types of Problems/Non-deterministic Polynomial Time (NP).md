A [[Decision Problem]]  is said to be in class **NP** if there is at least one [[Non-deterministic Algorithms]] that is able to verify a “yes” answer to the [[Decision Problem]], such that in the best-case scenario, this [[Non-deterministic Algorithms]] runs in [[Polynomial Time (P)]].

[[NP-hard]] - when **every** problem A in NP has a [[Polynomial-time Reduction]] to B

[[NP-complete]] - both an [[Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP)]] problem and a [[NP-hard]] problem

**Showing a problem is in NP**
1. Write a valid certificate
2. Write down the time complexity - if it's in Polynomial Time, it is in NP
