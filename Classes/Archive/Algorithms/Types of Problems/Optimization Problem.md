A problem is called an optimization problem if we want to find a **“best” solution**, given some input, and some constraints that the solution must satisfy. (There may be **more than one** “best” solution.)

**Transformation**
An optimization problem can be converted into a [[Decision Problem|decision problem]]
- Instead of finding a “best” solution, we are also given a **candidate solution**, and our goal is to decide whether the candidate solution is a “best” solution

Key Idea:
If we have a solution to an optimization problem, then we can use this solution to solve the “converted” decision problem.
