a **memory management technique** that provides an **abstraction** of the storage resources so that:
 1. It is **easier** for `N` processes to share the same _limited_ physical storage without interfering with one another.
2. It allows for the **illusion** (to users) of a _very large [[Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)|physical memory]] space_ without being limited by how much space that are _actually_ available on the physical memory device.
