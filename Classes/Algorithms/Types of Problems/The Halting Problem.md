Given a computer program 𝑃 and some input 𝐼, determine whether 𝑃 will terminate when executed with input 𝐼.

- This is a yes/no problem. The answer to the halting problem is either yes or no.
	- Yes, if 𝑃 terminates.
	- No, if 𝑃 runs forever (e.g. enters an infinite loop).
- If 𝐼 is not a valid input for 𝑃, then 𝑃 executed with input 𝐼 will terminate with an error message.
