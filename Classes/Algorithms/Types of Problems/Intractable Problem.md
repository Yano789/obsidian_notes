A problem that **cannot** be solved in [[Polynomial Time (P)]]

A problem, without any known solution that is able to run in polynomial time, may **not necessarily be intractable**.
- A solution may one day be found

Therefore, Intractable problems are guaranteed to have no possible solutions that run in [[Polynomial Time (P)]]

Famous Example: [[The Halting Problem]]
