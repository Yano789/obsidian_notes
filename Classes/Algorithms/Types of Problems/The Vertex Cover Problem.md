Problem: The vertex cover problem Given a simple [[Graph]] 𝐺, and given an integer 𝑘 ≥ 0, is there a [[vertex cover]] of 𝐺 of size 𝑘?

Note: The Vertex Cover Problem is in [[Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP)]] and [[NP-hard]]

**Key Idea:** 
Let 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸) be a simple [[Undirected Graph]] and let 𝑆 be a subset of 𝑉. Then 𝑆 is an 𝒌-[[independent set]] in 𝐺 if and only if 𝑉 − 𝑆 is a (𝒏 − 𝒌)- vertex cover of 𝐺.
