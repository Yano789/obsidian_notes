A problem is called a decision problem if its solution has two
possible outcomes
- Either “Yes” or “No”.
- Either “True” or “False”.
- Either 1 or 0.
- Either “Accept” or “Reject”
- ...

Verifying an answer to this kind of problem is known as a [[Verification Algorithm]]

Example 1: [[The Halting Problem]]
- Program 𝑃 will terminate when executed with input 𝐼: Yes or No?

Example 2: [[The Traveling Salesman Problem]]
- Does this route have the shortest distance, among all such possible routes?

A decision problem is said to be in class [[Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP)]]  if it is able to verify only a **"YES" answer** by running [[Non-deterministic Algorithms]] in [[Polynomial Time (P)]]
