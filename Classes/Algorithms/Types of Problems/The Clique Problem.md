Problem: Given a simple [[undirected graph]] 𝐺 and an integer 𝑘 ≥ 0, is there a 𝑘-[[clique]] in 𝐺?

Note: The clique problem is in [[Non-deterministic Polynomial Time (NP)]]

A possible [[certificate]] for a “yes” answer is a 𝑘-[[clique]]! 

Checking if a subset of 𝑘 vertices is indeed a clique takes [[Polynomial Time (P)]] to verify.

Note: The clique problem is [[NP-hard]].

Key Idea: There is a [[polynomial-time reduction]] of the [[independent set problem]] to the clique problem.
	- Consequence: The clique problem is [[NP-complete]]!
