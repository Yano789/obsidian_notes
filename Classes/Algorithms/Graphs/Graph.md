Represented as

	G = (V, E)

	where:
	1. V is a set of n vertices
	2. E is a set of m edges (pair of vertices)

**Two types of Graphs:**
1. [[Directed Graph]] - order of vertices on the edge matters
	a. [[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)]] - no cycles
2. [[Undirected Graph]] - ignore order
	a. [[Connected Graph]] - a path to any two vertices
	b. [[Disjoint Graph]] - dead ends

**Three ways to represent Graphs:**
1. [[Adjacency List]] (neighbors of each vertex)
2. [[Incidence List]] (edges from each vertex)
3. [[Adjacency Matrix]] (adjacent pairs)

[[Tree Graph]] - no cycles
[[Forest Graph]] - disjoint union of tree graphs
