> IP addresses (32 bits or 64 bits) are used to address datagram by routers:
> - For instance, IPv4 (32 bits) `172.217.194.99` (dotted notation a.b.c.d in groups of unsigned bytes – octet)
> - This is convenient for hierarchical routing: facilitates routing (remote router uses short prefix of destination IP address only to decide next hop – much smaller routing table)
