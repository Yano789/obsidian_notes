Queueing delay is the time [[Packets]] spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted onto the network link

![[Queueing Delay - 1.webp]]

**Duration**: varies, depending on traffic (congestion level). It is non trivial to compute.

**Cause**: packet input rate > link output rate, therefore packet needs to wait in the node buffer to get to the front of the queue to reach the output link.
