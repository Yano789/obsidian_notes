Propagation delay is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver over a given medium

**Duration**: depends on the physical length of the link. The amount of propagation delay is computed as: 
$$
d_{prop}=\frac{d}S
$$
where 
- d is the link length in metres, and 
- S is the propagation speed of bits on medium, it can be approximated to 2Ã—108 m/s.
