Ping is a another network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet [[Protocols]] (IP) network and measure the [[Traceroute#Round Trip Time]] for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer and back. It also relies on [[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)]] to work.

**How it works**: it sends ICMP echo request / reply [[Packets]] to the destination host. However, some hosts block ICMP echo requests for security purposes.
