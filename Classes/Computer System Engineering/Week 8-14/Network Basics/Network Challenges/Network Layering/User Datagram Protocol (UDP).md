UDP is a **connectionless** protocol that provides a simple and lightweight method for transmitting data [[Packets]] between devices. Unlike [[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]], UDP does not guarantee delivery or order of packets, making it faster but less reliable. It is commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming.
