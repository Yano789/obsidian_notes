Each ISP is in itself a network of [[Packet Switches]] and [[Communications Links]]. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL or wireless access.

ISPs also provide Internet access to **content providers**: a website or organization that handles the distribution of online content such as blogs, videos, music or files (Azure, Google, Cloudflare, Akamai, etc).

>Since the Internet is all about connecting [[End Systems]] to each other, the ISPs that provide access to [[End Systems]] must also be interconnected.
