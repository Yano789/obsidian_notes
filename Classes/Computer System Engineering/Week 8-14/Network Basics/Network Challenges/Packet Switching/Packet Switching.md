Packet switching is a method of data transmission where messages are broken into smaller [[Packets]], sent independently over a network, and reassembled at the destination.

It is an alternative way to share resources between [[End Systems]] (apart from [[Circuit Switching]]). Remember that the internet is a shared resource. It does not belong to just 1 or 2 end hosts.

*As you can see in the figure above, unlike circuit switching, packet switching resources are **shared** among many end users. Packets occupy network resources on **demand**. This is better for bursty data.*
