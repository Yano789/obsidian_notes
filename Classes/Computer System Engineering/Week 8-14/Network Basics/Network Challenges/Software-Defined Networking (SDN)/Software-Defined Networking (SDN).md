Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a **modern** networking architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane in network devices.

This separation allows for more flexible and efficient network management.
- In SDN, a **centralized** controller dynamically manages network behavior through software applications, providing a global view and centralized control over the network.
- This approach **enhances** scalability, simplifies network management, improves resource utilization, and enables rapid innovation by allowing network administrators to programmatically configure and manage network services.
- SDN is widely used in data centers, cloud environments, and enterprise networks to support dynamic, scalable, and automated network operations.
