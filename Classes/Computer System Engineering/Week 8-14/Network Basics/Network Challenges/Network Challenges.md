- **Operability**: How do the independent devices communicate and synchronize, what medium or protocols do they use?
	- Solution: [[Protocols]] and [[Application Programming Interface|API]] 
- **Sharing**: How do we control traffic of packets? How do we share resources between N hosts that wish to communicate with one another?
	- Solution: [[Packet Switching]] 
	- *NOTE: NOT [[Packet Switches]]*
- **Complex interacting components**: How do we manage the interaction between so many different types of devices, e.g: phones, micro controllers, computers, database servers, cars, etc?
	- Solution: [[Circuit Switching]]
- **Scalability**: How do we scale the network, so that it is able to support the growing number of devices?
	- Solution: [[Network Layering]] through the [[5 Layer OSI Model]]
