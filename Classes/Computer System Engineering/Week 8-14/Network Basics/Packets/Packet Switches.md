A packet switch takes a [[Packets|packet]] arriving on one of its incoming [[Communications Links]] and forwards that [[Packets|packet]] on one of its outgoing communication links.

Types of packet switches include:

- Routers
- Link-layer switches

They both **receive and forward packets**, but we will discuss the differences between the two later on. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.
