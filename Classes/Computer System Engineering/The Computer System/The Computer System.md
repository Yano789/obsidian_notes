## System Structure
### Multiprocessor System
Main advantages:
- **Increased throughput**: executing many processes in parallel
- **Economy of Scale**: cheaper than multiple single processor system
- **Increased Reliability**: If one core fails, we still have other cores to do the work 

#### Symmetric Architechture
