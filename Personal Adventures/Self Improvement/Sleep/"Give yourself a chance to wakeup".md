> The reason to early wakeup is to be productive, the way to be productive is to wakeup early

When you wake up in the morning, give yourself a moment to think. 
*"Should I snooze this alarm?" 
"I know I'm very tired." 
"What should I do if I wake up?"* 
These questions should not be answered by your sleepy self, of course they will choose to go back to sleep. 

**Give yourself a chance to wakeup and then make the decision.**
