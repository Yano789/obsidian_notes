# 1. Being realistic

When setting goals, don't write them down for the sake of writing them down. Reflect on what you are capable of and what you realistically can do. **Things like 5 Leetcode problems are not realistic when you can't even do 1.**

# 2. Have good days, not perfect ones

This is very true. I have experienced this, and my journal can testify it. Striving for the perfect day *everyday* means that you'll be sacrificing a lot just to squeeze everything from that day. Instead, strive for **good days on average.** Over time it will become the new normal for you and you can move on to the next thing.

# 3. Take your time
> "Sometimes I can read several pages and not retain anything, but lately Iâ€™ll read the passage out loud and meditate on a few things"

Good things take time. To have your good days on average, you need to take it step by step. Do what is important with a sprinkle of what you enjoy doing. You don't need to rush everything on the first day. Spread it out evenly throughout the week. You may be a machine, but even some machines need to rest.
