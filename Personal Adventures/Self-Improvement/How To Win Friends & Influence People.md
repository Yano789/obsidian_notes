## Appreciation vs Flattery
Do not over exaggerate things as they may come off as insincere

*Flattery*
> You are the best presenter I have ever seen! 
> You're the only one that could have pulled off such an amazing project!

Instead, come from a place of gratitude and genuineness

*Appreciation* 
> Your presentation was very interesting. I learnt a lot from it
> Your hard work on this project has not gone unnoticed
